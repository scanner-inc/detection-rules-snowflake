name: Snowflake abnormal usage of OAuth access token
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect abnormal OAuth access token usage in your Snowflake environment.

  ## Strategy

  This rule identifies when an account authenticates with an OAuth access token outside an automated service or driver.

  OAuth access tokens serve as digital keys for accessing protected resources. If an attacker compromises a user account, they may steal the associated access token.

  Reviewing access token usage during an incident can reveal unusual activity patterns, such as:

  - Access tokens being used from unexpected locations.
  - Access tokens being used to access unauthorized resources.
  - A sudden spike in access token usage.

  ## Triage and Response

  1. Inspect the logs to verify if the IP address aligns with expected user or service account behavior.
  2. Investigate unfamiliar IP addresses that are followed by query activity.
  3. If the account is compromised, recreate the access token.
