name: Snowflake UI login via password
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect a user account login using a password for authentication directly into the Snowflake UI.

  ## Strategy

  This rule detects when an account uses a password to log in to the Snowflake UI.

  ## Triage and Response

  1. Inspect the logs to identify the user or service account and associated IP address.
  2. Review the IP address against other logs associated with that user.
  3. Investigate whether the user has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled.
  4. If the IP address is new and MFA is not enabled, disable the user and rotate credentials.
