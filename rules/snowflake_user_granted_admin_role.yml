name: Snowflake user granted admin role
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect new admin grants to users in your Snowflake environment.

  ## Strategy

  This rule identifies when a user gains administrator privileges in Snowflake. If an attacker obtains these privileges, they may grant admin-level access to another compromised user to evade detection. The following admin permissions are available: AccountAdmin, OrgAdmin, SysAdmin, and SecurityAdmin.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Inspect the logs to identify the user, role granted, and timestamp.
  2. Investigate whether the user's elevated permissions are expected.
  3. If there are signs of compromise, disable the user associated with the admin grant and rotate credentials.
