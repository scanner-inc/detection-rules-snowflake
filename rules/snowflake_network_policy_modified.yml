# schema: https://scanner.dev/schema/scanner-detection-rule.v1.json
name: Snowflake network policy modified
description: |-
  ## Goal

  Detect when a network policy is created, modified, or deleted in your Snowflake environment.

  ## Strategy

  This rule identifies alterations to network policies.

  ## Triage and response

  1. Inspect the logs to identify the user who ran the query.
  2. Investigate if the user is an admin by referencing the Grants to User table in Snowflake.
  3. If the user is not an admin or was recently assigned admin, check for signs of compromise.
  4. Otherwise, review internal change management to verify if this was an expected change.
